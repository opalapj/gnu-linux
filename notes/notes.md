## `/bin/` - Essential user command binaries (for use by all users)

Place for most commonly used terminal commands, like `ls`, `mount`, `rm`, etc.

[More about symlinks to `/usr/bin/`][1]

`/bin` contains commands that may be used by both the `system administrator` and
by `users`, but which are required when no other filesystems are mounted
(e.g. in single user mode). It may also contain commands which are used
indirectly by scripts.

### Requirements

There must be no subdirectories in `/bin`.

[1]: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man7/file-hierarchy.7.html#compatibility%20symlinks

## `/etc/` - Host-specific system configuration

The `/etc` hierarchy contains configuration files. A "configuration file" is
a local file used to control the operation of a program; it must be static and
cannot be an executable binary. 

`/etc` contains system-global configuration files, which affect the system's
behavior for all users.

### Requirements

No binaries may be located under `/etc`.

The following directories, or symbolic links to directories are required in
`/etc`:

- `opt/` - configuration for `/opt`

## `/home/` - User home directories

`/home` is a fairly standard concept, but it is clearly a site-specific
filesystem. The setup will differ from host to host. Therefore, no program
should assume any specific location for a home directory, rather it should query
for it.

[More about `home`][2]

### Requirements

User specific configuration files for applications are stored in the user's home
directory in a file that starts with the '.' character (a "dot file"). If
an application needs to create more than one dot file then they should be placed
in a subdirectory with a name starting with a '.' character, (a "dot
directory"). In this case the configuration files should not start with the '.'
character. 

[2]: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man7/file-hierarchy.7.html#home%20directory

## `/opt/` - Add-on application software packages

`/opt` can be used to store additional software for your system, which is not
handled by the package manager.

## `/usr/` - Vendor-supplied operating system resources

`/usr` contains the majority of user utilities and applications, and partly
replicates the root directory structure, containing for instance, among others,
`/usr/bin/` and `/usr/lib`.

> NOTE:  
`usr` stands for `Unix System Resources`, not `user`!

## `/var/` - Persistent, variable system data

`/var` is dedicated to variable data, such as logs, databases, websites, and
temporary spool (e-mail etc.) files that persist from one boot to the next.
A notable directory it contains is `/var/log` where system log files are kept.

## Help

    man <command>
    man <reference>
    info <command>
    help <command>
    <command> --help

Examples:

    man man
    man hier
    man bash
    info bash
    bash --help

    man -f sysctl
    man -k sysctl

`man -f <term>` generates the same result as typing `whatis` i.e. list of all
pages that are called `<term>`

`man -k <term>` generates the same result as typing `apropos`

    man -a socket
    man 2 socket
    man 7 socket

The chapter number can be used to force `man` to display the page from
a particular chapter. It is common to have multiple pages across multiple
chapters with the same name, especially for names of library functions or system
calls.

## Creating a File

    touch <filename>
    touch -t <timestamp> <filename>
    touch -t 12091600 <filename>

## Creating a Directory

    mkdir <dirname>

## Moving, Renaming or Removing a File

`mv` does double duty, in that it can:

- simply rename a file,
- move a file to another location, while possibly changing its name
at the same time.

```
mv <source> <destination>
```

`rm` removes files and directories

    rm <filename>
    rm -i <filename>
    rm -r <filename>

## Moving, Renaming or Removing a File a Directory

`mv` does double duty, in that it can:

- simply rename a directory,
- move a directory to another location, while possibly changing its name
at the same time.

```
rmdir <dirname>
```

The directory must be empty or the command will fail.
To remove a directory and all of its contents you have to do:

    rm -rf <dirname>

`rmdir` works only on empty directories; otherwise you get an error.

While typing `rm –rf` is a fast and easy way to remove a whole filesystem tree
recursively, it is extremely dangerous and should be used with the utmost care.


## I/O Redirection

Through the command shell, we can redirect the three standard file streams so
that we can get input from either a file or another command, instead of from 
our keyboard, and we can write output and errors to files or use them to provide
input for subsequent commands.

For example, we have a program called `cat` that reads from `stdin` and writes
to `stdout` and `stderr`.

If you want to send the output to a file, use the greater-than sign (`>`) as in:

    cat > output-file

You can change its input source by using the less-than sign (`<`) followed by
the name of the file to be consumed for input data:

    cat < input-file

In fact, you can do both at the same time as in:

    cat < input-file > output-file

> NOTE:  
Using `cat` and I/O redirection we can copy content from `input-file` to
`output-file`.

Because `stderr` is not the same as `stdout`, error messages will still be seen
on the terminal windows in the above example.

If you want to redirect `stderr` to a separate file, you use `stderr`’s file
descriptor number (`2`), the greater-than sign (`>`), followed by the name of
the file you want to receive everything the running command writes to `stderr`,
e.g.:

    cat --unknown-option 2> error-file

> NOTE:  
By the same logic, `cat 1> output-file` is the same as
`cat > output-file`.

A special shorthand notation can send anything written to file descriptor `2`
(`stderr`) to the same place as file descriptor `1` (`stdout`):

    cat > all-output-file 2>&1

`bash` permits an easier syntax for the above:

    cat &> all-output-file

## Searching for files

    locate <pattern>

> NOTE:  
`locate` utilizes a database created by a related utility, `updatedb`. Most
Linux systems run this automatically once a day. However, you can update it at
any time by just running `sudo updatedb` from the command line as the root user.
The `locate` command in `Ubuntu` is typically used to find files quickly by
searching a prebuilt index maintained by the `updatedb` command. However, files
in the `/tmp` directory are often excluded from the index for performance and
privacy reasons.

    find <start-dir> <expression>
    find . -name "file*"  | start searching from current working directory
    find / -name "file*"  | start searching from root directory

> NOTE:  
Use `sudo` in case of presence of problems with permission, e.g. in `tmp` dir:  
`sudo find /tmp -type f -name "*file"`  
Additionaly, `find` has many `expressions` like removing found files (default
is `-print`):  
`sudo find /tmp -type f -name "*file" -delete` 

## Comparing files

    diff <filename1> <filename2>

GUIs:

- `diffuse`
- `vimdiff`
- `meld`

## Derermine file type

    file <file> ...

## Compressing data

![](image-27.png)

![](image-63.png)

## Archiving data

- list archive content:

        tar --verbose --list --file arch-name.tar
        tar vtf arch-name.tar

- creating `.tar` archive:

        tar --verbose --create --file arch-name.tar dir-to-arch
        tar vcf arch-name.tar dir-to-arch

- creating `.tar.gz` compressed archive:

        tar --verbose --create --gzip --file arch-name.tar.gz dir-to-arch
        tar vczf arch-name.tar.gz dir-to-arch

- extracting `.tar` or `.tar.gz` archive:

        tar --verbose --extract --file arch-name.tar
        tar vxf arch-name.tar

## Wildcards and Matching Filenames

| Wildcard | Result |
| --- | --- |
| ? | Matches any single character |
| * | Matches any string of characters |
| [set] | Matches any character in the set of characters |
| [!set] | Matches any character not in the set of characters |

# Installing software

![](image-19.png)

https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/pkgtools.en.html

`dpkg` is a package manager for Debian-based systems. It can install, remove,
and build packages, but unlike other package management systems, it cannot
automatically download and install packages – or their dependencies.

`apt` and `aptitude` are newer, and layer additional features on top of `dpkg`.

## `dpkg` - The Debian Package

The Debian Package is the software at the base of the package management system
in the free operating system Debian and its numerous derivatives. `dpkg` is used
to install, remove, and provide information about `.deb` packages.

> NOTE:  
`dpkg` is the low-level packaging tool that `apt` uses to handle packages.
Most "normal" user should only use `apt`, because it automatically handles
dependencies. Only in very special cases, where you want to install a specific
package, and you don't want to automatically resolve dependencies would you use
`dpkg`.

> NOTE:  
Uninstalling packages using `dpkg`, is NOT recommended in most cases. It is
better to use a package manager that handles dependencies to ensure that the
system is left in a consistent state. For example, using `dpkg -r zip` will
remove the `zip` package, but any packages that depend on it will still be
installed and may no longer function correctly as a result.

### Useful commands

- list all installed packages:
 
        dpkg --list

    > NOTE:  
    Without a pattern, non-installed packages will not be shown.

- list packages, even non-installed:

        dpkg --list vim
        dpkg --list "*vim*"

- list and count only installed packages:

        dpkg --list | grep "^ii" | wc --lines
        dpkg --get-selections | wc --lines

- get info about non-installed `package`, from `.deb` file:

        dpkg --info package.deb
        dpkg --info google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

- get info about installed `package`:

        dpkg --status package
        dpkg --status apt

- list files installed to your system from `package`:

        dpkg --listfiles package
        dpkg --listfiles bash

- show which `package` a file belongs to:

        dpkg --search filename-search-pattern
        dpkg --search /bin/bash

- install a `package` from `.deb` file:

        sudo dpkg --install package.deb

- remove a `package` (but not its configuration files):

        sudo dpkg --remove package

- remove a `package` (including its configuration files):

        sudo dpkg --purge package

## `apt` - The Advanced Packaging Tool

The Advanced Packaging Tool is the underlying package management system that
manages software on Debian-based systems. While it forms the backend for
graphical package managers, such as the `Ubuntu Software Center` and `synaptic`,
its native user interface is at the command line, with programs that include
`apt-get` and `apt-cache`.

> NOTE:  
The `apt package index` is a database of available packages from the
repositories defined in the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file and in the
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory. To update the local package index with the
latest changes made in the repositories, and thereby access the most up-to-date
version of the package you’re interested in, type `sudo apt update`.

> NOTE:  
Try to use autocompletion i.e. use `Tab` after type `apt list --` for possible
options.

### Useful commands

- update local package index:

        sudo apt update

- list all available packages from index:
 
        apt list
        apt list package

- list installed packages:

        apt list --installed
        apt list --installed package

- list upgradeable packages:

        apt list --upgradeable
        apt list --upgradeable package

- list and count packages:

        apt list --installed | grep "]$" | wc --lines
        apt list --upgradeable | grep "]$" | wc --lines

- search for the given regex term(s) in the list of available packages and
display matches:

        apt search regex

- show information about the given package(s):

        apt show package

- show dependencies for given `package`:

        apt depends package
        apt rdepends package

- install a `package` from repository:

        sudo apt install <package_1> <package_2> ... <package_n>

- install a `package` from `.deb` file

        sudo apt install /absolute/path/to/package.deb

- install all available upgrades:

        sudo apt upgrade 

- remove a `package` (but not its configuration files):

        sudo apt remove <package_1> <package_2> ... <package_n>

- remove a `package` (including its configuration files):

        sudo apt purge <package_1> <package_2> ... <package_n>

- remove no longer needed dependencies:

        sudo apt autoremove

## `aptitude`

Additional feature comparing to `dpkg` and `apt`:

    aptitude why package
    aptitude why-not package

## `synaptic`

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto

## `apt` vs `apt-get` / `apt-cache`

For basic commands the syntax of the tools is identical.

While `apt` is a command-line tool, it is intended to be used interactively,
and not to be called from non-interactive scripts. The `apt-get` command should
be used in scripts (perhaps with the `--quiet` flag).

## Identifying the Current User

    whoami
    who

Linux is a multi-user operating system, meaning more than one usercan log on at
the same time.

To identify the current user, type `whoami`.

To list the currently logged-on users, type `who`.

Giving `who` the `-a` option will give more detailed information.
